    "Earlier last, I was on a movie kick after seeing *Everything, Everywhere All At Once*. It was such a great movie I saw it in theaters 4 times, and I enjoyed each viewing the same! However, after I watched it the second time, I wanted to give other movies a chance because I really just enjoy the movie going experience. This time, I decided to go watch *Morbius*. I know him the comics and cartoon, *Spider-Man: The Animated Series*, and I liked his story, so I was interested. I also knew that it was not a part of the MCU, but with such a cool character it had to be decent. I erred. It was so bad, I just started watching superhero movie again a year later.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** While practicing SQL, I stumbled upon a dataset dataset containing details about each character like name, populatity, alignment, gender, height, weight, strength, speed, fighting skills, etc. This was the perfect dataset to answer the business problem. The data can be analyzed to find out who the people want like the most, but also who would be entertaining to watch based on their strenghts! We want Michael Bay level destruction and explosions!
